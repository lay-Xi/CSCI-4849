			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
          I have implemented a 5-key method for navigating and using the calculator. The arrow keys are used for movement (up, down, left, right) and the space bar is used for selection.
          Another 2-key layout is commented out in the code but, that method uses the right arrow key as movement and the down arrow as selection.
        </li>
				<li>
          <p>For my test, I tested the 5-key layout and a 2-key layout enter in the following equation, 98*7-654+321/2, followed by clearing the calculator. I had both layouts do this test 5 times and recorded the time it took
          and error that happened.</p>
          <p>The 5-key layout had a 18.224 second average speed for the test with a high of 20.72 seconds when 1 error occured.</p>
          <p>The 2-key layout had a 40.736 second average speed for the test with a high of 50.13 seconds when 1 error occured.</p>
          <p>From these results, I can conlude that having more keys/mobility allows the user to complete the task twice as fast, which is to be expected. The 5-key layout is much more forgiving with mistakes as it only added
          2 extra seconds when a mistake was made while the 2-key layout added an extra 10 whole seconds from the average when a single mistake was made.</p>
        </li>
				<li>I had tried to implement a one-key layout but, I had a bug where if you press the key twice, it would register the second key press as both a double tap and a single tap and would
        select and move to the next button. </li>
